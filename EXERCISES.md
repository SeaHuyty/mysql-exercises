### 2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)

This section covers exercises on querying and modifying data in a database.

* **Insert Data**
  Practice inserting data into tables using the `INSERT INTO` statement.
  *File: `insert_data.sql`*

* **Update and Delete**
  Work on writing `UPDATE` and `DELETE` queries to modify or remove data in existing tables.
  *File: `update_delete.sql`*

### 3. ER Diagrams

Explore exercises related to creating and interpreting Entity-Relationship Diagrams.

* **ER Diagram for a Library System**
  An example of designing an ER diagram for a simple library system, showing entities like books, patrons, and loans.
  *File: `library_er_diagram.pdf`*

* **Mapping ER to Tables**
  This exercise helps translate an ER diagram into relational tables.
  *File: `er_to_tables.sql`*

### 4. Relational Models

Here, you will learn how to convert logical database designs into relational models.

* **Mapping Relationships to Relational Models**
  This exercise involves converting a set of relationships into a relational model.
  *File: `relational_model.sql`*

### 5. Normalization

Normalization exercises help you break down complex data structures into more manageable forms.

* **1NF to 3NF Normalization**
  In this exercise, you’ll practice transforming a database from 1NF to 3NF.
  *File: `normalize.sql`*

### 6. Transactions

Learn how to work with database transactions and concurrency control.

* **ACID Transactions**
  This exercise covers writing SQL statements for managing ACID properties in transactions.
  *File: `transactions.sql`*

* **Transaction Control**
  Practice using `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT` to manage your database transactions.
  *File: `transaction_control.sql`*

### 7. Joins and Subqueries

This section focuses on combining data from multiple tables using joins and subqueries.

* **Inner and Outer Joins**
  Learn how to perform inner, left, right, and full outer joins.
  *File: `joins.sql`*

* **Subqueries**
  Practice writing subqueries for filtering and nested queries.
  *File: `subqueries.sql`*

### 8. Indexes and Views

Improve the performance and readability of your database with indexes and views.

* **Creating Indexes**
  In this exercise, you’ll learn how to create and use indexes to optimize query performance.
  *File: `indexes.sql`*

* **Using Views**
  Practice creating and using views to simplify complex queries.
  *File: `views.sql`*

## Additional Notes

Feel free to explore each exercise in detail and modify the queries for different use cases. Each exercise serves as a hands-on approach to learning core database concepts, and you can build upon these foundations to tackle more complex database challenges.
